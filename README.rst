Twitter scraper
===============

Getting started (Windows)
-------------------------

First, make sure you have installed *Python* on your system (version **3.8.0** or higher). It is also recommended that you install *git* as it makes downloading and updating this script easier.

* *Python* (https://www.python.org/)
* *Git* (https://git-scm.com/)

The Twitter download script provided in this package is a *command-line tool*. On Windows it can be run in an interpreter like *cmd*. To start the interpreter, press `<Windows key> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key>`_\+R and enter *cmd*.

After pressing *OK*, the command-line interpreter will open.

   :alt: run

Here, you can enter any commands and execute them by pressing *Enter*.

Step 1: Download the script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming that you have installed *git*, you can now enter the following command (and execute by pressing enter).

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/aarondettmann/twitter-scraper

The repository including the main script will be downloaded. Next, change into the newly created directory called ``twitter-scraper``.

.. code::

    cd twitter-scraper

You may list the files in the current directory by running ``dir`` in *cmd*. Here, you will see the main script called ``twitter.py``. You may also open the *Explorer* file browser which will show you the same files. To open Explorer in your current directory from the *cmd*, enter ``explorer .`` (notice the dot!).

üëç To update the Twitter script you do not need to download it manually (assuming you downloaded the repository using *git* before). In the *cmd*, navigate to the ``twitter-scraper`` folder using the ``dir`` and ``cd`` commands as shown above. In the ``twitter-scraper`` folder, run ``update.bat`` (works on Windows only) or ``git pull``. If there are any updates, these will be downloaded.

Step 2: Install additional Python libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the ``twitter.py``, you first need to install a few additional Python libraries. The simplest way to do this, is to the following command in a terminal:

.. code::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This automatically installs the following libraries:

* *twitter-scraper* (for access to the Twitter API)
* *openpyxl* (for writing to Excel files)

Step 3: Using the script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have followed the instructions above, you can now use the Twitter download script. Try to enter just:

.. code::

    python twitter.py

A short help page will be shown indicating the available command line arguments that are available.

Download Twitter data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``down`` mode in order to download twitter data. After the ``down`` keyword, you need to specify the ``USERNAME`` (Twitter account name). Use the optional argument ``-p NUMBER`` to specify how many page you want to download. To retrieve older/more tweets, increase the number of pages. Example:

.. code::

    python twitter.py down elonmusk -p 5

Instead of a user name it is also possible to use a *hashtag*. Note that you might have to put the hashtag in quotation marks (e.g. ``python twitter.py down "#aviation" -p 10``).

Excel files
^^^^^^^^^^^

When downloading Twitter data, it is by default saved as a JSON file and an Excel file (note that the JSON file may contain more information than the Excel file). In some cases it may be useful to manually convert a JSON file to Excel. In this case this can be achieved as shown in the following example.

.. code::

    python twitter.py xl data/elonmusk_2020-04-01_1030/data.json

This will generate an Excel file ``data/elonmusk_2020-04-01_1030/data.xlsx``.

*Adding filters*

When converting twitter data to Excel it is possible to add one or more filters. When adding a filter, additional sheets will be created in the Excel file. Filters can easily be added using the optional argument argument ``-f`` (or equivalently ``--filter``). In the following example four different filters are applied (*#Tesla*, *Tesla*, *SpaceX*, *dragon*).

.. code::

    python twitter.py down elonmusk -f '#Tesla' 'Tesla' 'SpaceX' 'dragon'

Notice the first two filters (*#Tesla*, *Tesla*). These are not equivalent. The first filter starts with a *#* which indicates that tweets will be filtered by hashtags only. The rest of the tweet text is ignored. When omitting the *#* the filter will look at both at the text *and* hashtags. If the filter keyword appears in either, the tweet will be included in the filter results.

Note that filter arguments are case-insensitive, so it does not matter if you type *TeSlA* or *tesla*. Both filter will yield the same result.

If you have downloaded data already, you can create a new Excel file with the applied filters. Be ware that existing Excel files may be overwritten.

.. code::

    python twitter.py xl data/elonmusk_2020-04-01_1030/data.json -f 'SpaceX' '#dragon'
